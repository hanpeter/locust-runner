## How to set up your local development environment

This instructions describe for the people who has never set up a Python development environment and provides what the Python development community considers as the best practice.

1. After the installation, verify you have `pip` installed and available from your path.
    * `$ pip --version` should return the version number and the location of the executable.
1. Update the `pip` to the latest version: `$ pip install pip --upgrade`
1. Install [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) via `pip`: `$ pip install pipenv`
1. Using `pipenv`, create an environment for `locust-runner`: `$ pipenv --three`
1. Install all dependencies using `pipenv`: `$ pipenv install`
1. Activate the environment created by `pipenv`: `$ pipenv shell`
1. Run `locust` with the `locust-runner`: `$ locust -f locust_runner/runner.py --no-web --only-summary`
